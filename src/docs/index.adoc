== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Contact Management Plugin

The +crm-contact+ plugin is the most frequently used plugin in {gr8crm} applications.
CRM is about managing customers and customer interactions. This plugin provides storage and services for managing
companies, people and relationships between them. You can use it as a simple address book or as the base of a complex
customer relationship management system. The plugin is generic but flexible, it has proven support for many different use-cases.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-contact-ui/[crm-contact-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface
for managing contacts and relations. +crm-contact-ui+ depends on +crm-contact+ so you only need to include +crm-contact-ui+
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user contact management features.

== Domain Model

=== CrmContactRelation

This domain class links two contacts together. An example would be to link an employee to it's employer.
The type of relation is specified by the +type+ property that references a +CrmContactRelationType+.

== CrmContactService

+CrmContact getContact(Long id)+

Find a contact based on primary key.

+CrmContact findByNumber(String number)+

Find a contact based on customer number.

+CrmContact findByName(String name)+

Find a contact based on name.

+PagedResultList<CrmContact> list(Map query, Map params)+

List contacts using query by example parameters.

+CrmContact createCompany(Map<String, Object> params, boolean save = false)+

Create a new company.

+CrmContact createPerson(Map<String, Object> params, boolean save = false)+

Create a new person.

+String deleteContact(CrmContact crmContact)+

Delete an existing contact.

== Code Samples

=== Create a company

To create a new company and store it in the database you use +crmContactService.createCompany(Map, boolean)+

[source,groovy]
.CreateCompanyExample.groovy
----
def technipelago = crmContactService.createCompany(name: "Technipelago AB", email: "info@technipelago.se",
                       url: "www.technipelago.se", address: [postalCode: "13973", city: "Djurhamn", country: "Sweden"], true)
----

The last parameter is +true+, this means that the company should be persisted (saved) to the database.
If the last parameter is false or omitted all properties will be set from the specified Map but the company
will not be persisted. You can later call +save()+ on the instance if you need to perform extra steps before persisting.

=== Create a person

To create a new person and store it in the database you use +crmContactService.createPerson(Map, boolean)+

[source,groovy]
.CreatePersonExample.groovy
----
def goran = crmContactService.createPerson(firstName: "Göran", lastName: "Ehrsson",
                email: "goran@technipelago.se", title: "Developer", true)
----

The last parameter is +true+, this means that the person should be persisted (saved) to the database.
If the last parameter is false or omitted all properties will be set from the specified Map but the person
will not be persisted. You can later call +save()+ on the instance if you need to perform extra steps before persisting.

=== Relations

Relations are used to connect contacts together. To connect an employee with it's employer you create a +CrmContactRelation+
between them. The domain class +CrmContactRelation+ has a property called +primary+ that specifies what relation is the primary
relation for that contact. A contact can have many relations but only one primary relation. A good example is the
employee<-->employer relation, were the relation from the person to it's employer (company) has the primary property set to true.
This affects things like address management and display of contact information.

[source,groovy]
.CreateRelationExample.groovy
----
def relation = crmContactService.addRelation(goran, technipelago, 'employer', true)
----

=== Search Contacts

To query the database for contact you can use +crmContactService.list(Map, Map)+. This first parameter accepts
a map of query values. The second parameter is a map with pagination parameters (offset, max, sort, order).

[source,groovy]
.SearchContactsExample.groovy
----
def result
result = crmContactService.list([name: "Göran"], [:]) // <1>
println result
[Göran Ehrsson]

result = crmContactService.list([name: "Tech"], [:]) // <2>
println result
[Technipelago AB]

result = crmContactService.list([person: true, related: "Tech"], [:]) // <3>
println result
[Göran Ehrsson]
----
<1> Find contacts who's name begins with "Göran"
<2> Find contacts who's name begins with "Tech"
<3> Find contacts of type person that have a relation to a contact who's name begins with "Tech"
